I have layed out the UI of this app to be very clear when interacting with it.
This includes titling data such as the names of quizzes, questions and options, 
as well as time allowed, number of questions and points. 

The layout of the page is also set up in the centre and consistently going down, 
making it easily accessible whether viewed on mobile or web.

Every page is scrollable to once logged in and you can transfer between the login
page and register page easily, which follows WCAG 2.0 accessibility guidelines.
